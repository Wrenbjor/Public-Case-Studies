# Case Studies

Real-world projects. Real problems. Real results.

## Enterprise Platforms

### [ReminderMedia](./ReminderMedia.md)
**$28M digital magazine platform built from scratch**

Walked into a political coup, lost entire dev team in week one, delivered a greenfield platform that generated $28M in year one. 7 microservices, zero-downtime deployment, 15,000 dead tests removed from legacy system.

*2016-2018 | Laravel, Python, Docker, Ansible, October CMS*

---

### [Comcast](./Comcast.md)
**Network configuration platform that outperformed Cisco Prime**

Built a system that reduced config error rates from 60% to under 3% across 20,000 devices and 27 regions. Nightly automated discovery, template-based config generation, millions saved in prevented outages.

*2008-2015 | PHP, Python, MySQL, SSH/Telnet automation*

---

### [Tamman](./Tamman.md)
**Accessibility powerhouse for Bank of America**

Built DevOps automation, WCAG 2.1 test suites, and award-winning accessible experiences for BofA. Paid the price for a CEO who couldn't keep up — three weeks before COVID proved me right.

*2018-2020 | React, GitLab CI, Docker, Ansible, Accessibility*

---

### [TripAdvisor](./TripAdvisor.md)
**The "worst idea ever" that Google built two years later**

Migrated legacy article system to StoryBlok, untangled a bureaucratic data pipeline nightmare, and pitched an AI-powered conversational homepage in 2023. They called it the worst idea ever. Google launched the same concept in 2025.

*2022-2023 | React, GraphQL, Java, StoryBlok, PHP*

---

## Startups

### [VINventory](./VINventory.md)
**Revolutionary auto parts tech buried by bad actors**

Built software for a startup with technology that could reverse-engineer OEM parts lists from any VIN — and exposed regional price manipulation in the auto industry. Discovered I was a pawn in a con. The tech sits idle.

*2020-2022 | Web scraping, VIN-to-OEM mapping, MOTOR integration*
